// @restart/kv-persist
//
// Storage-agnostic contract for durably persisting *versioned* records and
// rehydrating them later. Deliberately backend-independent and free of any
// grid / bloom / sync coupling: a record is just `{ id, v }` plus its payload,
// where `v` is a monotonic version. Implementations (e.g.
// @restart/kv-persist-indexeddb) decide *where* records live; consumers (e.g.
// a bloom row store, or any future data store) decide *what* to persist.
//
// CORRECTNESS NOTE FOR CONSUMERS: this layer persists records verbatim and
// never reasons about freshness. A persisted record is only valid for its
// exact `id:v`. Staleness must be resolved by the consumer comparing the
// persisted `v` against an authoritative source (e.g. a freshly-fetched
// manifest) and refetching anything whose version moved on. This is why the
// contract carries `v` at all.

/** Minimal shape every persisted record must have: a stable id + version. */
